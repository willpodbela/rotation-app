        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">What is The Rotation?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          Welcome to The Rotation. We provide our members with exclusive access to a closet full of designer clothes and
          streetwear for a fraction of the price. Our plans give you the ability to wear 2, 3, or 4 styles at a time, for
          as
          long as you went. When you're tired of a piece just send it back and select the next thing on your rotation.
          More
          access, more flexibility, and more experimentation for a fraction of the cost of retail or resale.

        </div>
        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">How does it work?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          For one low monthly price, you get access to hundreds of items from the world's best designers and brands. Wear
          them as much as you want, and when you want something new, send it back in the box with the pre-paid label we
          provided you. Your next rotation will arrive shortly after, and the process repeats. Endless fashion, right at your
          fingertips.

        </div>
        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">What type of clothing do you carry?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          We carry styles and brands all over the fashion spectrum. Between streetwear, luxury, avant garde, vintage, tech wear, hypebeast,
          and minimalist styles, our catalog and curation is limitless. We focus on tops, tees, outerwear, jackets, hoodies, parkas, and accessories primarily — with occasional special drops in more unique categories.

        </div>
        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">Do you ship internationally?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">

        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">Do you offer discounts for purchasing my item?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          If applicable, we offer a variable discount based on the amount of time you've had an item out. The longer you
          hold on to it, the bigger the discount, so you can make sure you love an item before you commit to it for life.

        </div>
        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">How often are new items released?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">

        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          A 'heart' is a way to save items in your catalog. Tapping on the heart will move items to your favorites, so you
          can access them easier for your next rotation. It lets our team know which styles you love, and what you may
          want
          more of, so heart away!

        </div>
        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">What should I do with the package or box?</h2>

          to alert you when that happens.

        </div>
        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">Do I have to return all my items at once?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          You do not have to return all your items together. If you want to hold on to one just a little bit longer,
          you're
          good to send back the others and those respective item slots will open up once we process those returns.

        </div>

        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          We hear you. Our catalog is vast, but strong. We recommend all new members to take their time and not rush the
          process. You have room for experimentation here, and anything you don't love, you can always send back whenever
          you're ready. Start off by favoriting items you know you love, then reserve the styles that are in-stock. If you
          need anymore help, our style team is waiting to help you out as well - just send over an email to <a href="mailto:concierge@therotation.club">concierge@therotation.club</a>

        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          These pieces are more than meets the eye. We suggest you give a style a shot. You'll be surprised about how good
          you
          feel and how confident you'll be in them.

        </div>
        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">What if I want more or less items at once?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          If you want to increase the amount of item slots on your plan, just send an email to <a href="mailto:support@therotation.club">support@therotation.club</a>
          and
          we'll upgrade your plan. If you want less item slots, the same process applied.

        <h2 className="font22 light title padding_top20">Why are some items "Sold Out"?</h2>
        <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
          That means other members are currently enjoying all of the available inventory of that particular item. Add a

      <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
        Some people call us that, but we believe we're more inclusive than just 'Rent the Runway for Men'. Anybody,
        regardless of gender, can subscribe to The Rotation. We believe our identity is in our style selection and
        curation, not gender lines.

      <div className="top10 font18 light rotation_gray">
      We love those guys — but we're a very different platform. Those platforms allow their users to browse, buy, and sell new or used inventory. We believe in a different solution — instead of going through the hassle of committing to a piece, a potential purchase regret, and then inevitably re-listing the item and losing money, you can just have peace of mind using the flexibility of The Rotation. Give us a try, you'll see what we mean.
