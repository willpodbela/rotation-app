Hey there,

I'm one of the co-founders of The Rotation. I wanted to thank you for being such an early waitlist member.

The Rotation started as an idea over dinner about a service Barron and I dreamed of having. After a long year of hard work, we are so excited to finally be bringing that dream to you.

If you have any thoughts, questions, or just want to grab a slice of Joe's near Union Square, feel free to reach out anytime. We hope to see you inside.

Best,
Zach & Barron
