Hey there,<br><br>I&#39;m one of the co-founders of The Rotation. I wanted to thank you for being such an early waitlist member.<br><br>The Rotation started as an idea over dinner about a service Barron and I dreamed of having. After a long year of hard work, we are so excited to finally be bringing that dream to you.<br><br>If you have any thoughts, questions, or just want to grab a slice of Joe&#39;s near Union Square, feel free to reach out anytime. We hope to see you inside.<br><br>Best,<br>Zach & Barron
